# Final iOS101 project: App ideas

### New App Ideas

1. Little Duolingo - The app could be about practicing a specific language, preferably one that is either not in Duolingo or does not have good quality or scope enough on certain courses. (Haitian Creole, Tagalog, Cantonese, Navajo to say the least)

2. OnceADay - Once a day, you get a single unique question or prompt like: "What did you notice today that felt magical and store it like how we did the task app, it saves with the calendar for each note.

3. Random Tasks - Have a To-Do list and you randomly get a task to do.

4. SongRate - Users each pick a song to match a mood/theme, and people vote on which song wins.

### Top 2 New App Ideas

1. OnceADay
    - Mobile: The app is better for mobile because it shows simplicity and daily habit formation using native push notifications and possibly Home Screen widgets. It doesn’t require an internet connection to function and makes use of device storage for journaling, making it an on-the-go experience that wouldn’t translate well to desktop.
    
    - Story: Provides users with a low-pressure space for creativity, mindfulness, and self-expression. The idea of building a personal archive, one thought or memory at a time, is emotionally appealing and would likely resonate with users who value journaling or reflection.
    
    - Market: People who want to journal but often feel overwhelmed by blank pages. This includes mindfulness practitioners, creatives, and users exploring emotional wellness. While the journaling space is competitive, OnceADay’s one-prompt simplicity offers a fresh take that lowers the barrier to entry.
    
    - Habit: The once-a-day format encourages users to return regularly without pressure. It turns journaling into a quick, daily thing that can fit into anyone’s lifestyle. Users generate their own content with every use, which provides personal investment and attachment over time.
    
    - Scope: The core product can be built with just a daily prompt, a text field for journaling, and a simple log of past entries. There’s no need for user accounts, AI, or heavy integrations. It’s clean, clear, and very doable within a short development cycle.
 
2. SongRate

    - Mobile: Relies on features like audio playback, push notifications, and real-time interaction, all of which are difficult to replicate well in a web-based environment. It can also integrate with Apple Music or Spotify APIs to pull in song previews, making the experience fluid and native to the mobile platform.
    
    - Story: The app turns playlists into playful battles, giving users a reason to engage daily with friends or strangers in fun, low-stakes challenges. It’s highly shareable and would likely generate excitement among peers, especially within music-loving social circles.

    - Market: The market for this app is broad and vibrant, including music fans, playlist curators, and social gamers. The app offers huge value to a niche group—those who enjoy expressing themselves through music and comparing tastes.
    
    - Habit: This app can become habit-forming because it encourages repeat engagement through daily or weekly battles, ongoing results, and social bragging rights. Users both create and consume content by submitting songs and voting in challenges, making the experience participatory and sticky.

    - Scope: A stripped-down version of the app where users simply pick songs, vote, and view the winner is still entertaining and fun to build. It can be built quickly using SwiftUI, Firebase, and Apple’s MusicKit API without needing complex backend systems or AI. It should be straight forward with less technical background possible.
