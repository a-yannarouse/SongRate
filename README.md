## Overview

### Description

A music battle app where you and a friend each pick a song for a theme, and others vote on the best choice.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment & Music
- **Mobile:** Relies on features like audio playback, push notifications, and real-time interaction, all of which are difficult to replicate well in a web-based environment. It can also integrate with Apple Music or Spotify APIs to pull in song previews, making the experience fluid and native to the mobile platform.
- **Story:** The app turns playlists into playful battles, giving users a reason to engage daily with friends or strangers in fun, low-stakes challenges. Itâ€™s highly shareable and would likely generate excitement among peers, especially within music-loving social circles.
- **Market:** The market for this app is broad and vibrant, including music fans, playlist curators, and social gamers. The app offers huge value to a niche groupâ€”those who enjoy expressing themselves through music and comparing tastes.
- **Habit:** This app can become habit-forming because it encourages repeat engagement through daily or weekly battles, ongoing results, and social bragging rights. Users both create and consume content by submitting songs and voting in challenges, making the experience participatory and sticky.
- **Scope:** A stripped-down version of the app where users simply pick songs, vote, and view the winner is still entertaining and fun to build. It can be built quickly using SwiftUI, Firebase, and Appleâ€™s MusicKit API without needing complex backend systems or AI. It should be straight forward with less technical background possible.
